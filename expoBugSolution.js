This solution focuses on debugging strategies rather than providing a specific code fix because the "uncommon Expo CLI error" is vague. The key is methodical troubleshooting to identify the underlying incompatibility:

1. **Update Expo CLI:**  Use `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli` to update to the latest version.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` to update your project's dependencies to the versions recommended by Expo. Then, follow with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Check Native Module Integration (If Applicable):** Ensure all native modules have been correctly installed and configured according to their documentation for Expo compatibility.  Look for any error messages during the module's installation or linking process.
4. **Clean the Project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`). This eliminates any potential issues caused by corrupted or inconsistent dependency installations.
5. **Examine Build Logs:**  The Expo CLI usually provides some logs even for generic errors.  Examine those logs carefully; sometimes a hidden message can point towards the actual problem.  Look for warning messages, missing plugins, or errors related to specific packages.
6. **Isolate the Problem:** If possible, try removing features from your application one by one until the error disappears. This helps to pinpoint the specific part of your project that's causing the issue.
7. **Consider Using EAS Build:** Expo's EAS Build service can sometimes resolve build issues related to environmental differences or complex dependencies.

The `expoBugSolution.js` (intentionally empty) illustrates the importance of debugging rather than simple code changes for this type of error.  The real solution depends on the cause that the detailed debugging process uncovers.
