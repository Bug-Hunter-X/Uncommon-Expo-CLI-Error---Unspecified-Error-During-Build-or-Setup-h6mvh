This error typically occurs when using Expo CLI in conjunction with a project that has dependencies or configurations that are not compatible with the Expo managed workflow or with the specific Expo CLI version being used.  It doesn't point to one specific code error but rather a mismatch between expectations and reality. For instance, using a native module that isn't properly configured for Expo, incorrect package versions in your `package.json`, or an outdated Expo CLI version can all lead to this vague error.
